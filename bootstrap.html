                            Hello world! My name is Derrick!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                                I am a 24 year old from Louisville, Kentucky now living in Savannah, Georgia. 
                                I'm currently pursuing my passion at Gerogia Tech for Web Developement, which I'm really 
                                excited about. This is my second post-high school education adventure simply due to the fact
                                that I love to learn. I graduated from Armstrong State Univeristy in 2014 and then again in 2016.
                                In 2014 I recieved an associates degree in Health Science and in 2016 I finished out my courses
                                and recieved a bachelors degree in Health Science with Health Adminstrations track. After my third
                                year into the Health Adminstration program, I started to develope my love for coding. It 
                                started out learning from online tutorials how to create very basic websites for certain ideas
                                I had in the past. Then it blossomed into developing webistes for other people for different things like
                                businesses, ideas, or just because I thought it would be a cool design. 
                    <p>
                        Now I am pursuing my passion, Web Devlopement, at Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp. I've been telling myself 
                        since I graduated from ASU that I would go back to school for my passion and I'm glad it's with 
                        a quality school like Georgia Tech. I also have a four year old daughter named Carley. She's a beautiful
                        little ball of joy in my life that keeps me going. I wouldn't be here without the motivation 
                        she gives me everyday to push harder so that her quality of life is prestin, because that
                        is what she deserves. I currently work at Cellular Sales, which is a Verizon authorized retailer.
                        I've worked here for three years in October/2019. I am now a trainer for Cellular Sales, which would 
                        include the tasks of training new sales reps, help with creating training curriculum, as well 
                        as maintain the sales numbers that are required.
